            Established in the year 1946, the Portland State University in the United States was framed fundamentally as
            an instructive foundation for war veterans of the World War 2. In any case, throughout the years that
            followed the underlying establishment of this post-war college, it was transformed into a four-year school
            with a 'College' status being allowed to it in 1969. The Portland University has been positioned among the
            main 15 percentile colleges of United States by the Princeton Review in the year 2012. <br>

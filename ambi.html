        <h2>Ambitious, Moderate or Safe University ??</h2>
        <img src="img/ambicopy.jpeg" alt="Ambitious" class="img-fluid" /><br><br>
        <p>
            The time has come for students to test their competence as the Universities have started to reply to the
            various
            applications of a myriad of prospective students from all over the country for the coveted Master’s degrees
            or
            the Bachelors Degree courses in the USA. Some have received good admits from excellent education
            establishments,
            while some are disappointed with their rejects, some are waiting with utmost patience for their chance
            staring
            into their mailboxes and application status tabs on university websites. <br><br>

            Among all this I come across various posts on various websites as well as some social media forums wherein
            the
            students have mentioned about their results. Some are simply happy that they have received at least 1 admit
            while some are distressed as they have received rejects from Universities which they considered to be “Safe”
            for
            them. In some cases I have even seen them using abusive language in respect to the universities for
            rejecting
            their application and this hurts me. Being a counselor for around 4 years and holding a Master’s Degree from
            a
            reputed US University, I find these acts slightly immature for a student of this caliber.<br><br>

            I completely understand the disappointment that they may face and their frustration but I believe this not
            to be
            the right platform to display it. During my application as well, I did face a few rejections and that did
            break
            my morale up to a certain level, but I realized the importance of patience rather than playing the blame
            game
            with these established institutes. It is important for us to remember that, “They may or may not need us,
            but we
            surely need them…” Why do we suggest students to not apply only to a single University and await a decision,
            but
            on an average we see students applying for 8-10 Universities classifying from an Ambitious to Moderate to a
            Safe
            range. <br><br>

            My simple question here is, who defines the University to be Ambitious, Moderate or Safe? What would be the
            standards that create that bifurcation for it? Honestly, we only use previous data, knowledge of seniors or
            counselors or in many cases rankings published by various sources. But again, can we see or conclude any
            foolproof theory from these sources?<br><br>

            The correct answer will be no. These sources available to us are to guide us to make informed choices but in
            the
            end the University Application and University Selection should be in the hands of the students.
            Unfortunately in
            India almost every College or University selects a student using the ‘Objective’ Grading System while in the
            US,
            they follow the ‘Subjective’ Grading System. In India, if you score 99% marks in the Entrance Test for any
            institute, you are almost through while in the US, they consider various factors before making the
            decision.<br><br>

            I have read on various posts where the student asks the question, “I scored 318 in the GRE, yet University
            rejected me while my friend got 310 in the GRE, yet the same University accepted him.” Or “I scored 1360 on
            the
            SAT which was required by the University, yet they did not give me admission in CS but a different major.”
            These
            comparisons bring out the negative vibes for the Universities and students start to curse them. But does
            anyone
            go and check the overall profile of the student, does anyone check the academic score of the student, the
            papers
            presented, the projects worked on – how innovative or how efficient were they, what was the impact of the
            Statement of Purpose of the student and the Recommendation Letters of? The answer here again is “NO”. Many
            times, students get the feeling of disappointment due to their feeling of rejection by one a single factor
            while
            honestly, that’s not the case.<br><br>

            I was in the US for 2 good years wherein I completed my Master’s, I have my friends who have completed their
            studies there, I have students who have either completed their studies or are still studying and we all
            interact
            with the professors there and a general consensus given by the professors there is that they need students
            who
            can add value to the program at the University. There is a science behind the selection of the students.
            They
            check the previous data, look at the students coming from different Colleges/Universities across the globe,
            their GPAs, their GRE/TOEFL Scores, their projects and they check the value addition done by these students
            at
            that particular University. They look at the Undergraduate/High School GPA of the student and how that GPA
            corresponds with the GPA of the University and how well the student can fit into the system of the
            university.<br><br>

            They check the GRE (for masters) or SAT (for undergrad) scores to check the analytical abilities of the
            students
            and how well the students can cope up with the projects and the courses available on campus. They check the
            projects carried on by the students in the past and how well they can start working on projects in the
            University. Once a professor candidly told me that he doesn’t value the GRE score but he would like to meet
            the
            student, check his/her confidence and then offer them a project available with him. I found this justifying
            and
            working on a project with him was a different experience.<br><br>

            While applying to any University, many students work with the mindset that A + B + C + D + E = Success at
            that
            particular University where A = Academics, B = GRE/SAT & TOEFL/IELTS Scores, C = Projects Undertaken/High
            School
            Activities & Technical Papers Published, D = Work Experience/Community Service and E = Extra-Curricular
            Activities. Universities however work on another level altogether. They grade a student profile subjectively
            and
            a deficiency in any of the above mentioned factors can be covered by some other factor. Unfortunately,
            students
            here think that if they meet the minimum cutoff in any of the sections, they are sure to get accepted by the
            University.<br><br>

            I have also seen some students advising some other students about the selection of the Universities and
            telling
            them that a particular University is way below their profile and they should avoid it and go ahead with some
            other better ranked university. If a student is happy with the courses and the research projects offered by
            a
            particular university, why should he/she be worried about the ranking of the university? The student is
            getting
            a chance to work on the project that he/she aspires to work on and in this case no one else should stop them
            from doing so. Sharing of information or guiding someone is never an issue but sharing wrong information and
            misguiding is a big issue and I have seen many careers heading in a wrong direction owing to this.<br><br>

            This article is my personal opinion churned out with experience as well as discussions with friends and
            students
            who are already in the US. This article reflects their views too and its motto is to purely guide the
            students
            and open their eyes to the ‘Subjective’ pattern of grading and selection as opposed to the ‘Objective’
            pattern
            followed in India. This article is also to open the eyes of the students against various Myths and help them
            make informed choices based on the information available to them and not let anyone misguide them. I hope
            everyone find their dream universities and I hope the concept of Ambitious, Moderate and Dream Universities
            takes a back-foot and selection of Universities based on Courses available and Research options available
            take a
            giant stride forward.<br><br>

        Are you making these common mistakes in writing SOP and application essays?<br>
        How to avoid most common mistakes while writing SOP or other application essays for your MS, MIS and MBA
        applications?<br>

        Today, we will look into how to avoid some common pitfalls.<br>

        Here are some common problems we have observed- <br>

        Rehashing the resume:<br>

        SOP is not a verbose form of your resume. The worst SOPs are the ones that say – 'I graduated from XYZ with a
        GPA of 8.9. Here, I took courses A, B and C and did projects E, F and G. After graduation, I joined company K
        and worked on blah blah'. The problem here is that it is adding nothing to what you have already told in your
        resume, so you are wasting a precious opportunity to connect and communicate to the admissions committee what
        your other unique qualities are.<br>

        SOP is your personal story that is unique to you. Use it to highlight your soft qualities, successes and
        failures. Show them your vision and why you will make a great student. Show them that you have done the
        groundwork and you know what you are talking about.<br>

        Hollow claims: <br>

        Nothing is more frustrating than reading a page full of baseless claims. As in literature, one rule holds true
        here as well – don't tell, show it to me. If you say you are hard working, show it – give me a specific example
        that will tell me you are hardworking without having to say it. Same goes with claiming that you are an
        innovative thinker. When a student tells how he came up with unique ways to raise huge funding for a college
        event, I automatically know that he can think out of the box. So, instead of inserting hundred of adjectives
        there, try to tell 3-4 meaningful stories that show what you are capable of.<br>


        Lack of confidence:<br>

        Did you read other SOPs and felt that others had something to write about but you have nothing? Believe me, you
        have as much to write as they did and your life is no less eventful than theirs. Their SOP got to that point
        after multiple iterations. If you see anyone's first drafts, you will snicker! So, don't lose heart, just get
        started.<br>

        Lack of planning: <br>

        Writing a SOP takes time and you should have at least good 4-5 weeks for the revisions and your final draft
        should come after at least 3-4 iterations. Why? Because howsoever great you may be in last minute work
        (especially the engineers), SOP needs reflection which takes time. You may have skipped some important event or
        detail in the first time and you only remember as you revise and revise. You have to proactively think – 'what
        makes your profile credible, strong and interesting'. Build a theme and structure for telling your story. Best
        SOPs are the ones that connect small parts of the applicant's life (decisions and events) with a bigger vision
        and goal. It is a matter of building a story and it takes time. You just cannot rush it.<br>

        Discounting your failures: <br>

        Often, students avoid talking about things that they haven't done well at such as GRE score, GPA, a course grade
        etc. However, you can use your failures to demonstrate that you have the ability to overcome these – and that
        makes for some very strong stories! For e.g. look how an applicant uses his failure to demonstrate another
        strength-<br>

        With my father's illness and added responsibilities at home, my academic performance in second year suffered a
        lot and my GPA took a plunge. However, it only made me more motivated to work harder and restore my confidence.
        With extra hours and renewed focus, I was able to restore my GPA to a more respectable figure. While it is way
        below what I feel I am capable of, I am proud that I could take care of my family when needed and still manage
        three B's in that semester.<br>

        Now you can imagine what will the admission committee feel about such an applicant – sure, his GPA might be much
        lower than many other applicants but he has demonstrated enough determination to overcoming hurdles and
        embracing failures. This is undeniably a strong admirable quality to have in a student. Choose to be honest.
        After all, there are humans in the admission committee who may appreciate an honest explanation way more than a
        denial.<br>

        Being too humble:<br>

        Ok, so I understand that humility is a virtue and all that. But at the end of the day, an applicant needs to
        sell himself to the admissions committee and the SOP is his advertisement. That's right – SOP is a marketing
        tactic. This does not mean that you have to be dishonest, it just means that you cannot afford underselling
        yourself. This is your chance to shine and sometimes, humility can mislead since the admission committee doesn't
        know you well enough to understand that you are just being shy or humble (especially Indians), they will take
        your lack of self-praise to be lack of accomplishments. Don't fall into that trap! You need to speak up for
        yourself loud and clear (it is not the same as indulging in self-flattery or braggadocios). If you have achieved
        something, take pride in it and mention it without sounding arrogant. Sell yourself.<br>

        Cheesy cliches :<br>

        Don't try to fit in by citing similar examples and using same quotes that thousand other applicants are using.
        Try to tell YOUR story in your own words. Note that admission committee goes through thousands of SOPs and can
        only remember those who stand out. Everyone is writing about 'how I began assembling computer at the age of
        five' or 'made my first game at the age of eight'. Be honest and spend more time preparing your story – I am
        sure there is a way to make your honest story sound as impressive. So, don't take a short cut by following any
        pattern – spend some time and tell your own story.<br>

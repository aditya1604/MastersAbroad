    <p>
        <h1>What is a Letter of Recommendation (LOR)?</h1> <br><br>
        A Letter of recommendation is a letter issued by the professor/academician or manager that you have worked along
        with in the past. It's generally one of the mandatory documents that universities require for BS, MS, PhD or MBA
        programs abroad. Letter of Recommendation (LoR) is very important as its helps the admissions committee know
        about your technical, academic and non-academic expertise through your recommender. It shows your discipline and
        dedication towards your studies and the way you respond in class or workplace. The content in the recommendation
        is extremely important. So, choose your recommenders wisely.<br><br>

        Factors on which the universities expect you to be rated by your recommender are as follows:<br>
        1. Current / Final standing in your undergraduate class
        2. Comparison with the students who have gone for graduation in the same university
        3. Communication skills (Oral and written skills)
        4. Creativity
        5. How well you understand the subject
        6. Teaching Potential
        7. Emotional Maturity
        8. Recommendation with Financial aid or not
        9. How strongly they recommend you (Very strongly, strongly, moderately, etc.)

        <h3>Types of LOR Letter of Recommendations:</h3><br>

        Letter of Recommendation can be broadly classified into 2 types based on the Nature of the Recommender and
        various courses.<br>

        1. Academic LOR<br>
        A letter of recommendation provided by your professor of college or school. Usually universities ask students to
        provide two or three letters of recommendation from your previous institute. This could be from teachers at your
        school in case of undergraduate or bachelors (BS) courses and from professors at your college if you are
        planning to pursue a masters (MS) or PhD program.
